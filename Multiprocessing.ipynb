    "- Execution: Multiple threads run within the same process.\n",

    "- Best For: I/O-bound tasks, like network requests, file operations, and web scraping.\n",

    "- Memory Sharing: Processes do not share memory by default, leading to isolated memory spaces.\n",

    "- Data Sharing: Harder; requires inter-process communication mechanisms like pipes or queues.\n",
    "- Resource Usage: More memory-intensive; each process has its own memory allocation.\n",
    "- Overhead: Higher overhead, as starting a new process is more resource-consuming.\n",
    "- Complexity: Less prone to race conditions, but requires explicit data-sharing methods.\n",
